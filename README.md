## 🛠️ Materials Required

- Mild steel rods (2) – for head and handle  
- Lathe machine  
- Center drill  
- Cutting tool  
- Vernier caliper  
- Drill bit  
- Knurling tool  
- Polishing tools

## 🔧 Procedure Overview

1. Faced the ends of the mild steel rod to obtain smooth flat surfaces.  
2. Drilled center holes to align the workpiece for further operations.  
3. Turned the rod to the required outer diameter using a single-point cutting tool.  
4. Performed turning operations for various diameters.  
5. Applied knurling on the gripping area for a better grip.  
6. Polished the surface to improve the finish.  
7. Faced and turned the head part to the required dimensions.  
8. Drilled a hole in the hammer head for handle insertion.  
9. Assembled and fixed the handle securely.
